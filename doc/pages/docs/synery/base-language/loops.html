<h2>Loops <span class="label label-warning">draft</span> <span class="label label-danger">Experimental</span></h2>

<p>
In Synery loops can be used to traverse records from a table. It is very close to <code>foreach</code>-loops in other languages like C# or PHP.
</p>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>
Assume we have this table:
</p>

<table class="data">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="4">\people</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Id (INT)</th>
            <th>Firstname (STRING)</th>
            <th>Lastname (STRING)</th>
            <th>Size (INT)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>Mike</td>
            <td>Meyer</td>
            <td>182</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>22</td>
            <td>Sandra</td>
            <td>Smith</td>
            <td>168</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>38</td>
            <td>Rachel</td>
            <td>Lopez</td>
            <td>175</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Now we'd like to loop threw all rows. For that we need to create a new record type and used it to create a record from each row:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
#Person(INT Id, STRING Lastname);

// Returns the ID of the first person with the given lastname
INT getIdOfFirstRecord(STRING lastnameFilter)

    // start the loop
    EACH #Person p IN \people
        IF p.Lastname == lastnameFilter
            RETURN p.Id;
        END
    END
    
    RETURN -1;
END

INT firstSmith = getIdOfFirstRecord("Smith");   // = 22
</textarea>

<p>
Please note that the <code>#Person</code> only has two fields but the table <code>\people</code> has four columns. Synery only assigns the columns for witch a field is available. For doing this Synery compares the field names of the record type with the column names of the table. Only a column with exactly the same name (case sensitive) as the field is assigned.
</p>

<p>
That also works the other way: If the record type has a field which the table doesn't have the field is just initialized with NULL. So it's also possible to have more fields in a record type than the traversed table has columns.
    </p>
