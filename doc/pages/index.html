This is the technical manual of the Interface Booster environment and its scripting language "Synery". It can be used as reference for developers and technicians.

<h3>What does the Interface Booster do?</h3>
<p>
The Interface Booster is a software for fast developing stable and high quality interface applications which exchange business data between any applications, formats, files or services.
</p>
<p>
One of the big benefits of using Interface Booster is that the developer doesn't have to deal with the specifics of the foreign systems and formats. A Provider Plugin will do that for him.
