<h2>Delete <span class="label label-warning">draft</span></h2>

<p>
The DELETE-Command is used to export modified data to a foreign system or a file by using a connection (see: <a href="#/synery/provider-plugins/connect">Connect</a>).
</p>

<h3>The DELETE-Command</h3>

<p>
A DELETE-command always uses this pattern:<br />
<b><code class="block">
DELETE [endpoint_path] FROM [table_identifier] <br />
SET ( [parameter_name] = [expression] , ... ) <br />
FILTER ( [field_name] [operator] [expression] ... ) <br />
{Nested Commands} <br />
END
</code></b>
</p>

<p>
Description:
</p>

<dl class="definition">
    <dt>DELETE [endpoint_path]</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Required.</em>
        Takes a path of an endpoint starting with two backslashes <code>\\</code>. The identifier starts with the name of the connection followed by the path to the endpoint. An example: <code>\\myConnection\someCategory\endpointName</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>FROM [table_identifier]</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Optional.</em>
        If the resource demands a schema then the FROM-argument has to specify the path of a local table that matches the declared schema. This means that the given table at least must contain all required (non-nullable) fields.
    </dd>
    <dt>SET ( [parameter_name] = [expression] , ... )</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Optional.</em>
        The SET-argument is used to specify a comma-separated key-value parameters list. These parameters are passed to the provider plugin within the request.
    </dd>
    <dt>FILTER ( [field_name] [operator] [expression] ... )</dt>
    <dd>
        The FILTER-Argument is used to specify a filter for reducing the amount of records that are deleted. Only records in the foreign system or file that match the given filter criteria are removed.
    </dd>
    <dt>{Nested Commands}</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Optional.</em>
        Some nested commands.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Here you see three examples of how an delete operation could be performed:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
DELETE \\csvConnection\Data FROM \toDelete\positions END

DELETE \\erp\staff\employments
    SET (RemovePermanently = TRUE)
    FILTER (DateOfLeaving < DATETIME(2014,1,1))
    READ employments TO \remaining\employments  FIELDS (Id, IfStaffMember, Workload) END
END
</textarea>
