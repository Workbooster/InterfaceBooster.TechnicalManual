<p>
The Connect-Command is used to create a connection to a foreign system or a file by using a provider plugin. A connection is required to perform import and export commands.
</p>

<h3>The Command</h3>

<p>
A connect-command always uses this pattern:<br />
<b><code class="block">
CONNECT "[provider_plugin_instance_name]" <br />
AS [connection_identifier] <br />
SET ( [parameter_name] = [expression] , ... ) <br />
END
</code></b>
</p>

<p>
Description:
</p>

<dl class="definition">
    <dt>CONNECT "[provider_plugin_instance_name]"</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Required.</em>
        Takes the <code>syneryIdentifier</code> of the plugin instance specified in the <a href="#/interfacebooster/interface-definition">Interface Definition</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>AS [connection_identifier]</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Required.</em>
        Takes the external identifier starting with two backslashes <code>\\</code>. An example: <code>\\myCategory\someConnection</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>SET ( [parameter_name] = [expression] , ... )</dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Optional.</em>
        The SET-argument is used to specify a comma-separated key-value parameters list that can/must be used to configure the connection.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Here you see two examples of how a connection could be created:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
CONNECT "CSV 1.0" 
    AS \\csvConnection 
    SET ( File.Path = @"D:\temp\artikel.csv", Parser.Separator = ";" ) 
END

CONNECT "MS SQL 2012" 
    AS \\sqlConnection
    SET ( 
	Connection.DataSource = @"(local)\SQLDEVELOP", 
	Connection.Port = 1433,
	Connection.User = "dev", 
	Connection.Password = "123", 
	Connection.Name = "PX000000" )
END
</textarea>

<p>
In the first command you see an example statement for creating a connection to a CSV file by using a provider plugin instance with the name "CSV 1.0". The connection is inetrnally identified by the name <code>\\csvConnection</code>. This name can later be used to perform import and export commands. Two parameters are used for opening the connection.
</p>

<p>
The second command looks quite the same as the first one but it opens a connection to a SQL Server. It uses a provider plugin instance called "MS SQL 2012" and stores the connection in <code>\\sqlConnection</code>.
</p>

<p>
As you can see the two commands addresses totally different targets but look quite the same.
