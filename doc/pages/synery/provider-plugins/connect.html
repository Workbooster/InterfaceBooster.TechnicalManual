<p>
The Connect-Command is used to create a connection to a foreign system or a file by using a provider plugin. A connection is required to perform import and export commands.
</p>

<h3>The Command</h3>

<p>
A connect-command always uses this pattern:<br />
<b><code>CONNECT "[provider_plugin_instance_name]" ( [parameters] )? AS [connection_identifier] ;</code></b>
</p>

<p>
Description:
</p>

<dl class="definition">
    <dt>[provider_plugin_instance_name]</dt>
    <dd>
        The <code>syneryIdentifier</code> of the plugin instance specified in the <a href="#/interfacebooster/interface-definition">Interface Definition</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>( [parameters] )?</dt>
    <dd>
        A comma-separated key-value list of parameters which can/must be used to configure the connection.
    </dd>
    <dt>connection_ identifier</dt>
    <dd>
        An external identifier starting with two backslashes <code>\\</code>. An example: <code>\\myCategory\someConnection</code>.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Here you see two examples of how a connection could be created:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
CONNECT "CSV 1.0" ( File.Path = @"D:\temp\artikel.csv", Parser.Separator = ";" ) AS \\csvConnection;

CONNECT "MS SQL 2012" ( 
	Connection.DataSource = "(local)\SQLDEVELOP", 
	Connection.Port = 1433,
	Connection.User = "dev", 
	Connection.Password = "123", 
	Connection.Name = "PX000000" 
) AS \\sqlConnection;
</textarea>

<p>
In the first command you see an example statement for creating a connection to a CSV file by using a provider plugin instance with the name "CSV 1.0". Two parameters are used for opening the connection. The connection is identified by the name <code>\\csvConnection</code>. This name can later be used to perform import and export commands.
</p>

<p>
The second command looks quite the same as the first one but it opens a connection to a SQL Server. It uses a provider plugin instance called "MS SQL 2012" and stores the connection in <code>\\sqlConnection</code>.
</p>

<p>
As you can see the two commands addresses totally different targets but look quite the same.
