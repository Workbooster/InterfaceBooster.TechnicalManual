<h2>Syntax <span class="label label-success">reviewed</span></h2>

<p>
The syntax and the keywords of Synery are reduced to a minimum. We tried to find a good compromise between less syntax and good readability.
</p>

<h3>Special Chars</h3>

<p>
As a part of a degree dissertation at a professional school in switzerland it was analyzed how much time an average user (with less or no IT know-how) needs to find some special chars on its keyboard. Based on this analysis only these special chars are used in Synery:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
    - + * / \ . : ; , _ ( ) " ' ? ! % & = @ $ # < >
</textarea>

Special chars that an average user doesn't regularly use are not part of the Synery syntax. For example these special chars <b>are not used</b> in Synery code:

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
    [] {} |
</textarea>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>
Synery keywords all are written in capital letters. A few examples:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
    STRING, INT, BOOL, TRUE, CONNECT, IMPORT, EXPORT, SELECT, RETURN, IF, ELSE, NULL
</textarea>
<p>
<a href="#/synery/base-language/keywords-and-operators">Here you can find a list of keywords that are used in Synery.</a>
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>
In Synery comments can be written like in C-based languages:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
    // a single-line comment
    
    INT fife = 5; // an other single-line comment after a statement
    
    /*
        Or:
        A multi-line comment.
    */
</textarea>
