<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>
Every variable in Synery has its type. This can be a <a href="#/synery/base-language/primitive-types">primitve data type</a> or a <a href="#/synery/base-language/record-types">record type</a>. Once a variable is declared its type cannot be changed. Synery is so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety" target="_blank">"type safe"</a>.
</p>

<h3>Declaring a Variable</h3>

<p>
A Variable is declared by defining a type and a name:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
STRING someText;
INT aNumber;
#MyRecordType someRecord;
</textarea>

<p>
At this time the variable isn't initialized with a value yet. Its current value is NULL.
</p>

<h3>Initializing a Variable</h3>

<p>
A variable is initialized by setting a value using the equality sign "=".
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
INT aNumber;    // declaration
aNumber = 5;    // initialization
</textarea>

<p>
It's also possible to declare and initialize a variable at the same time:
</p>

<textarea class="editor" data-editor="synery">
INT aNumber = 5;    // declaration and initialization
</textarea>
